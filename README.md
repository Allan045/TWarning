<p align="justify">Software metrics and thresholds have been pragmatic means to detect technical debt and improve software products. Several studies have proposed and evaluated the usefulness of software metrics for practitioners, for instance, to indicate technical debt in software systems. As a result, developers may pay the debt by checking if there is something wrong in the system design or code and fixing anomalies to avoid future maintenance issues. Our tool provide a straightforward approach to help the developer to write better code since the beginning, by providing a view with class metrics and warnings considering the software project domain.</p>
